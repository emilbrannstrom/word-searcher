I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
Let's run with it because it's all we can take
One thing I'd never see, the same way around
I don't believe it and it slips from the ground
I want to take you to that place near the rush
But no one gives us any time anymore
He ask me once if Iâ€™d look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kissin' in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said
Listen to you brother, and listen to me
I didn't want to anymore
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause there's nowhere else I could go
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me
I saw my memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs the scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars
Hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't wanna sing anymore
Listen to you brother, and listen to me
I didn't want to anymore
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause there's nowhere else I could go
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause there's nowhere else I could go
I don't wanna start, don't get upset
I'm not with you
It's all I do when I'm with you
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause there's nowhere else I could go
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
